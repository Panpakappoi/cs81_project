Issues: 
I think on login page there may be an issue with getting a 400 on authorization code. If it refuses to take you to the splash please navigate to 
http://localhost:5173/splash

App takes in user info to display some of them as well as a built in player. CSS style was adopted from a previous thing I did, hence why some of the semantic CSS doesn't really make sense.
React was kind of a fun experience, but... the code I have right now is not performant. 

Running on Vite with localhost:5173. 


Is kind of what it looks like. 
If the navigation to login fails, you'll have to manually navigate there.

From here you should be able to navigate to splash page
